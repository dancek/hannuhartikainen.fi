    USB: add RESET_RESUME quirk for NVIDIA Jetson devices in RCM
    
    NVIDIA Jetson devices in Force Recovery mode (RCM) do not support
    suspending, ie. flashing fails if the device has been suspended. The
    devices are still visible in lsusb and seem to work otherwise, making
    the issue hard to debug. This has been discovered in various forum
    posts, eg. [1].
    
    The patch has been tested on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, but I'm adding
    all the Jetson models listed in [2] on the assumption that they all
    behave similarly.

    docs: submitting-patches: clarify the role of LKML
    
    The documentation previously stated that LKML should be used as *last
    resort*. However, scripts/get_maintainer.pl always suggests it and in a
    discussion about changing that[0] it turned out that LKML should in fact
    receive all patches.
    
    Update documentation to make it clear that all patches should be sent to
    LKML by default, in addition to any subsystem-specific lists.

    docs: gpio: explain GPIOD_OUT_* values and toggling active low
    
    I was confused about the gpiod_flags values and thought that
    GPIOD_OUT_LOW and GPIOD_OUT_HIGH set the line to be active low / active
    high. This is not true, but I got the misconception because the flags
    GPIOD_OUT_*_OPEN_DRAIN do change line configuration and there's a
    subchapter about *active low* and *open drain* semantics.
    
    Add an explicit mention that the initial value is a logical value (and
    not the line configuration or physical line level). Also add a mention
    of the function gpiod_toggle_active_low which was previously missing
    from this document.

    iio: adis: set GPIO reset pin direction
    
    Set reset pin direction to output as the reset pin needs to be an active
    low output pin.

    USB: cdc-acm: blacklist Heimann USB Appset device
    
    The device (32a7:0000 Heimann Sensor GmbH USB appset demo) claims to be
    a CDC-ACM device in its descriptors but in fact is not. If it is run
    with echo disabled it returns garbled data, probably due to something
    that happens in the TTY layer. And when run with echo enabled (the
    default), it will mess up the calibration data of the sensor the first
    time any data is sent to the device.
    
    In short, I had a bad time after connecting the sensor and trying to get
    it to work. I hope blacklisting it in the cdc-acm driver will save
    someone else a bit of trouble.
