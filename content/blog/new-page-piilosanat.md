I added a new page to my site: [Piilosanat]({{< ref "/piilosanat" >}}). That's *cryptic crosswords* in Finnish. The page contains a couple of tools useful for working with crosswords and cryptics in Finnish and a single cryptic crossword I finished constructing today.

I might try my hand at constructing something in English at some point, too. The tooling would be ok for English, but they default to a Finnish wordlist.
