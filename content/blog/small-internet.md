I've had my current homepage (mostly a blog) for a bit over two years now. It has served its purpose: I've written technical content and gained experience. I will continue to do so at my own leisurely pace.

But in May I found some very interesting things.
* [Gemini, the recently-invented text-based protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
* [The small internet](gopher://republic.circumlunar.space/~spring/phlog/2019-01-16__The_Small_Internet.txt) [movement](https://proxy.vulpes.one/gopher/republic.circumlunar.space/0/~spring/phlog/2019-01-18__Small_Internet_Manifesto.txt)
* [Tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/)
* [The slow social network](https://rawtext.club/)

I very soon got myself a VPS, moved this website over, and set up a Gemini server. I've now written 16 blog posts on [gemini://hannuhartikainen.fi](gemini://hannuhartikainen.fi). I've made a couple of my own gemini-related pieces of software in Rust and Python, and contributed to a couple in Rust, Go and Python.

Gemini is not for everyone. But for those who enjoy long-form text content written by ordinary people, it's a nice fast-growing scene.

After a while I also started checking out tildeverse and pubnixes (*nix community servers you can join). I realized I can actually get my first name as nick, so I'm now hannu@rawtext.club, @hannu@tilde.zone etc. Time will tell whether I'll use those in the long run. It's been fun to try, at least. I especially like the idea of rawtext.club: building communication tools for *nix users that only write in home dirs.

So this is me: a nerd overjoyed by some still-uncharted territory. Writing unpolished content and hacky software in the esoteric corners of the small internet. If this interests you, install a Gemini client or get a pubnix account!
